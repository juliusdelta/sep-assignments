Simply doubling the array won't always gurantee a "one time fix" for instances where some keys end up the same. Depending on
the hashing function, you can end up repeatedly having to double the array in to resolve one collision. If you were to go another
route based on some other mathematical property, like prime numbers, this would have a much smaller chance of happening.

This is a very expensive operation for just one collision. Especially if it had to happen mulitple times like in the above
hypothtical. Then you end up having memory allocation for an array potentially much larger than you actually need. Doubling
is not a good solution.
