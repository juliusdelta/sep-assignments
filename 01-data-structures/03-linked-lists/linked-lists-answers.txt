What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

* Spacial locality benefits performance by logically assuming that similar location in memory will be required to complete a specific process
or lookup. So instead of just pulling the specific location of a piece of data, it also pulls some of the surrounding data, which, in
probability will be used to complete a process.
